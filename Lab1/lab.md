# Week 1 - Setup, Introduction to Networking (OSI 7-Layer Model), HTTP, REST

## Lab Objectives

In this lab you'll learn the following:

* The OSI 7-Layer Model of networking
* Where to find specifications for the various layers
* TCP/IP vs UDP/IP
* What a socket is, and how to program sockets in Python
* How to use SSH
* A Practical way to boot into a Python program on the Raspberry Pi3
* What HTTP is, and how it's used for APIs
* What REST is and how it's used for APIs
* What curl is, and how to use it to debug APIs
* How to make a headless (no web page) API on the Web
* How to host a Python app on Heroku

## Game Plan

1. First, we'll have a brief introductory **lecture** about the course, the instructor,
the Internet of Things.
2. In **Part A** of this lab, you will set up your Raspberry Pi3 (Pi3) and GitLab so you
are ready for the rest of the course. Those who took course 110A have already done
this step.
3. Next, we'll have a **lecture** about the OSI 7 Layer Model of Networking and explore some
networking concepts.
4. **Part B** of this lab shows how to set up the Raspberry Pi3 to boot into a program.
Specifically, this program will display the IP address of your Pi3.
5. Next, we'll take an online **quiz** using the Pi3 as your quiz client.
6. Another lecture, this time on sockets. What is a socket, how does it work?
7. **Part C** of this lab will use **sockets** to send/recieve packets, both under
TCP/IP and UDP/IP, and to use curl on TCP
8. Some lecture on HTTP, REST, CURL 

how to use an online resource (Heroku) and your RPi3 to build
a class-room quiz application (called Quizical), using your RPi as a Python Client and a
Flash Application (online) as a Server

Another **lecture** will focus on the Network and Transport layers of a network

**Part D** Shows how to use curl for communicating an HTTP server. Note: CURL can be used  


## Homework

Setup a free Heroku account for hosting your own IoT applications. Host Quizical and send
a link to me.
